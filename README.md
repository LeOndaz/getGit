gG is an app for downloading specific folders from GitHub without the need of cloning the whole repository.
gG downloads specific folders from GitHub repositories with 2 simple steps.

NOTE : 

- You can type Home, home, ~/ and the app will download in your home directory.
- You can leave the Dir empty, & the app will sort it out.

In your repo URL, You need to change the branches to trunk/branchName, except if it's tree/master as the app sorts this out 
for you. 

Soon : 
- Support for windows

Suggestions for features are welcomed, --> ahmeddark369@gmail.com ,If you face a bug, drop it on my email.

gG needs no permissions, but you need to place it in a directory where you have permissions. otherwise, use as Sudo [it will tell]

The app has many bugs, they will be fixed soon.
